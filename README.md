  <h1 style="color: red;">‚òïÔ∏è Hi ! Welcome on my GitHub Profile </h1>

<h2>üçª Who I am ? </h2>

<p> I'm a french full stack web developer, and also a Discord Bot Developer. I enjoy coding and deep learning. Currently a student at ESIEE Paris <3</p>

<h2>üíª My Work </h2>

<p>There is my portfolio that is dedicated for this category, here it is : <a href="https://zedroff.engineer/">Link</a>. But I generally do expressJS backend with NodeJS, and ReactJS frontend for my front/back websites, and I also make Discord Bots and APIs sometimes.</p>

<h2>üõ† What you will find here ? </h2>

<p> You will find all my projects with their codes so you can maybe take some ideas from them, as an OSS enthousiast, I like sharing what I learnt / what I understood about coding concepts. I will not post everything, but I am trying to tend to a profile that is able to show all my skills for any recruiters that is concerned by my profile.</p>
